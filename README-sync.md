# üìù AMF Git & Dashboard Sync Cheat Sheet

---

## When You Want to Make Local Changes

1. **Pull the Latest from GitHub**
   ```sh
   git pull origin main
   ```
   _Why:_ Ensures you have the latest dashboard/server changes (like new covers or edits).

2. **Make Your Local Changes**
   - Edit code, data, or covers as needed.

3. **Stage and Commit Your Changes**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your local changes"
   ```

4. **Push Your Changes to GitHub**
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

## If You Get a Merge Conflict

- Open the conflicted file(s) (e.g., `covers.json`).
- Edit to resolve the conflict (keep both sets of good changes).
- Then:
  ```sh
  git add packages/coverflow/data/covers.json
  git commit
  git push origin main
  ```

## When You Make Changes in the Dashboard

- Click **‚ÄúPush Live‚Äù** in the admin dashboard.
- The server will auto-commit and push the latest data to GitHub.
- **Before making any local changes, always do a `git pull` first!**
