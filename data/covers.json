Her vocals carry a quiet intensity, layering youthful clarity over emotional depth reminiscent of artists who defined alt-pop for a new generation.\nRuby’s songs are subtly prismatic—shifting effortlessly between vivid emotion and elusive mystery, warmth and introspection.\nBeyond her standout singer-songwriter talent, Ruby is a poly-artistic force, incorporating guitar finesse, imaginative illustration, and mixed-media art into her creative arsenal. These visual explorations deepen the vivid daydream that is her developing world—rounding out a creative universe that feels both tangible and dreamlike.",

The son of country artist Jack Ingram, he grew up immersed in storytelling, developing a style that merges intimate, deeply felt lyrics with hooks that hit on first listen. Obsessed with the craft, self-taught in production, and relentless in his pursuit of mastery, Hudson is carving his own lane—one that feels classic, yet completely his own.",
